***How it Works***
-----------------------------------------
Once the room reaches 27 degrees Celsius/80 degrees Fahrenheit, or movement is sensed, the vent door will rotate from its original 23 degree location to an open 90 degree angle, allowing air to exit through the vent. Otherwise, the vent remains closed or reverts back to its original location.
